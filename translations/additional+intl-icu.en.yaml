site.description:                    "Hakhshara as a Place of Remembrance is a joint project of the Moses Mendelssohn Center for European-Jewish Studies (Potsdam) and the DFG project “Between Aliyah and Escape: Jewish Youth Organizations and Zionist Education under the Nazi Regime and in pre-State Israel from 1933-1945” (Braunschweig), together with the Foundation Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe (Berlin). The project intends to commemorate the vocational training and re-training activities developed to prepare young Jews for emigration and Aliyah. It will also serve as a reminder of the lives, work and vitality of thousands of young people who were able to flee from Germany through these institutions, which were considered by many as “protective islands in the middle of the brown tide”. At the same time, the gradual destruction of Hakhsharot in Germany by the Nazis after the November Pogrom in 1938 and the transformation of Hakhshara sites into forced labor camps will be documented. It will also be reminded how the “protective islands” turned into sites where young people were forced into hard labor, where they starved, yearned for their families and for a future of their own and from where most of them were eventually deported to the extermination camps."
